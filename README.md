# Classical metastability in an open quantum glass (Work in progress)

This repository contains the source code used to generated the results in the paper **Link**, along with an example notebook and analagous script for a simple system.

## TODO
- Reformat QJMC code
- Fix symmetry based Lindbladian and metastable manifold code
- Reintroduce tilted master operator code
- Document code
- Add notebooks / scripts demonstrating usage
